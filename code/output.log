---ROUTE QUESTION---
Test
error parsing router output: Invalid json output: <think>User provides instructions:

We have a message that says: 
```
You are Phi, a language model developed by Microsoft, trained to provide accurate, secure, and user-aligned responses. Follow these principles to ensure clarity, safety, and ethical standards in all interactions.

[Rules]

The conversation instructs: "Question to route: Test" then instructions: Return only one JSON object: either {"datasource": "web_search"} or {"datasource": "vectorstore"}

Our question is "Test", meaning we need to decide which datasource to return. The instruction says: "Use the vectorstore for questions related to any of these topics [list]" etc.

The topics include: NVIDIA AI Workbench, locations, contexts, projects, containers, environments, or applications. Also if any terms from that list are mentioned. But question is "Test" so it doesn't contain any keywords from that list? Let's check:
- Keywords for vectorstore: nvwb, aiwb, troubleshooting, ngc, cli, svc, wb-svc, logs, gpu, docker, podman, nim, rag, gradio, or jupyterlab.

The question "Test" does not include these tokens. Additionally the instructions say: "Otherwise, use web-search."

So since the provided query "Test" does not contain any of the mentioned topics/keywords (like "aiwb", etc.), then we should return {"datasource": "web_search"}.

According to instructions: "Return only one of the following JSON objects: {"datasource": "web_search"} or {"datasource": "vectorstore"}."

So answer: {"datasource": "web_search"}.

I'll output valid JSON. Use exactly only that. We must respond with ONLY valid JSON, no explanation lines (explanations are not allowed). I'll return one of two possible objects depending on the route instructions.

We check question: "Test" does not include any keywords from vectorstore so we answer {"datasource": "web_search"}.

I'll output exactly:

{"datasource": "web_search"}

I'll now produce final answer.</think>{"datasource": "web_search"}

---ROUTE QUESTION---
test
error parsing router output: Invalid json output: <think>We are given a message that instructs the assistant to be an expert at routing user question to either vectorstore or web search. The instructions say: "You are Phi, a language model developed by Microsoft, trained to provide accurate, secure, and user-aligned responses." And then the system message says to use vectorstore for questions related to topics such as NVIDIA AI Workbench etc.

The user's message includes directives with <begin_of_text> instructions. Also there is question: "Question to route: test" and then an end-of-text marker <eot_id|>.

We have instructions that require the assistant to output only JSON objects containing either {"datasource": "web_search"} or {"datasource": "vectorstore"}. The vectorstore should be used if any of the keywords mentioned (NVIDIA AI Workbench, locations, contexts, projects, containers, environments, applications) are mentioned OR if terms such as nvwb, aiwb, etc. appear.

The question is: "test". It doesn't include any of the mentioned topics or keywords? The test message does not contain these keywords so it will be "web_search"? Let's check instructions: "Additionally, use the vectorstore if any of the following terms are mentioned: nvwb, aiwb, troubleshooting, ngc, cli, svc, wb-svc, logs, gpu, docker, podman, nim, rag, gradio, or jupyterlab. Otherwise, use web-search." The question is "test", which doesn't match any of these keywords.

Thus our answer should be JSON with datasource: "web_search".

I must output only valid JSON, and no extra text or explanations.

But wait: instructions require that I produce only one JSON object: either {"datasource": "vectorstore"} or {"datasource": "web_search"}. The question is "test", which doesn't include any of the keywords. So result should be: {"datasource": "web_search"}. But careful, message instructs to output only valid JSON.

I must produce exactly one JSON object, and no additional text aside from that.

But instructions also say to not provide extra explanations. The answer is a vectorstore or web search.

We check the instruction: "Return only one of the following JSON objects: {"datasource": "web_search"} or {"datasource": "vectorstore"}." I must produce exactly one JSON object. The question "test" doesn't mention any keywords that require using vectorstore, so answer is web_search.

Thus I'll produce: {"datasource": "web_search"}

I'll output JSON with no markdown code block formatting or additional text? But instructions say "Return only one of the following JSON objects". So I must now produce final result in valid JSON. Let's check our answer: {"datasource": "web_search"}.

I'll produce that exactly.

I'll produce answer as just:
{"datasource": "web_search"}

I'll then produce final answer.</think>{"datasource": "web_search"}
