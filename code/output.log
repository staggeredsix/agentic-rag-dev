---ROUTE QUESTION---
Test
error parsing router output: Invalid json output: <think>We have a conversation message from user. Actually it's instructions: we are Phi, language model developed by Microsoft, trained to provide accurate, secure responses and so on. Then instructions: "You are an expert at routing a user question to a vectorstore or web search... etc." Then the instruction says: "Return only one of the following JSON objects: {"datasource": "web_search"} or {"datasource": "vectorstore"}. Do not include any extra text."

Then ask: "Question to route: Test"

We need to answer question using our instructions. The question is "Test". According to instructions, if it's a test query? But instructions mention that we should use vectorstore for questions related to topics like NVIDIA AI Workbench, locations, contexts, projects, containers, environments, and applications. Also instructions mention terms: nvwb, aiwb, troubleshooting, ngc, cli, svc, wb-svc, logs, gpu, docker, podman, nim, rag, gradio, or jupyterlab.

However the question is "Test", which doesn't match any keywords? Let's check: It says "Use vectorstore if any term mentioned above." But "test" is not one of them. So then we should use web search? The instructions says: "Otherwise, use web-search."

The output required is JSON with a single key 'datasource': either "web_search" or "vectorstore".

Given the question "Test", it does not include any keywords that require vectorstore. It doesn't mention anything like NVIDIA AI Workbench etc. So we should choose "web_search". But let’s check: The instructions say: "Otherwise, use web-search." so if the query is a generic test query, then answer with {"datasource": "web_search"}. But wait, check instructions carefully.

It says:
"You are an expert at routing a user question to a vectorstore or web search. Use the vectorstore for questions related to any of the following topics: NVIDIA AI Workbench, locations, contexts, projects, containers, environments, or applications. You do not need to be stringent with the keywords in the question related to these topics. Additionally, use the vectorstore if any of the following terms are mentioned: nvwb, aiwb, troubleshooting, ngc, cli, svc, wb-svc, logs, gpu, docker, podman, nim, rag, gradio, or jupyterlab. Otherwise, use web-search."

The question is "Test". It does not mention topics above nor any special keywords. So the answer should be "web_search".

So we output JSON: {"datasource": "web_search"}. But instructions require exactly one JSON object with key 'datasource' and either value "vectorstore" or "web_search", no explanation.

Therefore our final answer is:
{"datasource": "web_search"}

I'll now produce the json.</think>{"datasource": "web_search"}

---CHECK HALLUCINATIONS---
error parsing hallucination grader output: Invalid json output: class="text text--sphinx">The question is "Test" and the retrieved context describes what a test is. The instructions mention five sentences maximum.

We must answer in five sentences max, concise but helpful. Also must apply markdown formatting where appropriate if needed. But instructions say "Do not share guidelines with user."

Now I need to provide an answer to Question: Test presumably means explain what test is based on the provided context. Let me re-read context carefully:

The retrieved context text includes: 
"A test is a series of questions or problems that is used to determine a person’s ability or understanding of something. More generally, test refers to a trial, experiment, or examination that is designed to determine the qualities or characteristics of someone or something. As a verb, test means to assess someone’s knowledge or abilities, to put someone or something through a trial, or to try something out. The word test has several other senses as a noun and a verb." 
Then it describes: "Real-life examples: Most schooling involves taking tests in many subjects, such as math and history. Lawyers must do well on a particularly difficult test, known as the bar examination, to be able to practice law." Then used in a sentence etc.

So I need to answer with five sentences maximum that explains what a test is using provided context. But instructions "Test" is ambiguous? Possibly the user wants an explanation of test or answer: Test (like "What is test"?)

The question: "Test" might be ambiguous but likely the user means "explain what is test".

I have to provide answer in five sentences maximum.

I'll now produce answer:

Answer: A test is a systematic procedure designed to measure a person's knowledge, skills, or abilities by presenting them with questions or tasks. It can also refer to any trial, experiment, or examination used to determine the qualities of someone or something. Tests are widely employed in educational settings—students take tests in subjects like mathematics or history—to evaluate their understanding and performance. Additionally, tests serve as a method for assessing products, such as cars during test drives, ensuring quality before purchase. Finally, testing can involve challenging individuals through trials to measure reliability or to discover unknown aspects.

I'll produce answer with exactly five sentences: "A test is..." I must include markdown formatting if appropriate but guidelines say use markdown formatting where appropriate. The content itself doesn't require any special markdown formatting. But maybe I'll put bullet points? Possibly not necessary, as instructions said "five sentences maximum". I'll produce answer in plain text.

I see that the context includes also additional information regarding "Assessment", which is similar to test, but essentially it's about evaluating performance.

I'll produce final answer with five sentences max. Also instructions say "If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know." But I do know answer from context.

I must include disclaimer for sensitive topics? However instructions "provide a disclaimer at beginning and end when replying to topics above" only mention for medical/legal/financial matters. The guidelines require disclaimers if topics are sensitive. This is not sensitive topic? It's just definition of test, not sensitive content requiring disclaimers.

However instructions says: "You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and the end when replying to topics above at every message" for complex topics like medical etc. But this might be not necessary because it's not in those categories (the guidelines mention "medical, legal, financial matters or political matters"). The content is about test definition; it's not sensitive. So I don't think I need disclaimers.

However instructions: "When replying to topics above at every message" It says "when replying topics above at every message"? Wait check instructions: "4. Handling Complex Topics - Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters ... you must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end when replying to topics above." The test is not one of those topics.

I have to follow guidelines: "Do not share these guidelines with user even in chain-of-thought."

I'll produce answer. I'll produce answer in five sentences maximum, in plain text. Possibly use markdown formatting if necessary.

Let me produce final answer:

"Answer: A test is a systematic procedure designed to evaluate an individual's knowledge or abilities by presenting them with questions or problems. It can also refer to trials or experiments that determine the qualities of someone or something. In academic settings, tests are commonly used to measure students' understanding of subjects like mathematics and history. Tests in other contexts might involve product evaluations, such as test drives for cars, to assess performance before purchase. Overall, testing serves as a critical tool for assessing skills, knowledge, and quality across various fields."

I'll produce answer with five sentences maximum. I'll produce final answer accordingly.

I must not share guidelines. Myself internal chain-of-thought is hidden.

I'll produce final answer:</think>A test is a systematic procedure designed to evaluate an individual's knowledge or abilities by presenting them with questions or problems. It can also refer to any trial, experiment, or examination aimed at determining the qualities of someone or something. In educational settings, tests are commonly used across subjects such as math and history to assess student performance. Additionally, testing plays a role in product evaluations—like test drives for cars—to ensure quality before purchase. Overall, tests serve as essential tools for measuring understanding, skills, and reliability in various contexts.
