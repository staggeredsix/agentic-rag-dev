---ROUTE QUESTION---
test
error parsing router output: Invalid json output: <think>User message is in the context. There is a text block that instructs to route question "test" to one of two JSON responses: either {"datasource": "web_search"} or {"datasource": "vectorstore"}, based on routing instructions.

We are asked: "You are an expert at routing a user question to a vectorstore or web search. Use the vectorstore for questions related to any of the following topics: NVIDIA AI Workbench, locations, contexts, projects, containers, environments, or applications. Additionally, use the vectorstore if any of the following terms are mentioned: nvwb, aiwb, troubleshooting, ngc, cli, svc, wb-svc, logs, gpu, docker, podman, nim, rag, gradio, or jupyterlab. Otherwise, use web-search. Give a binary choice 'web_search' or 'vectorstore' based on the question."

The question to route: "test" is not in any of these topics? Let me examine instruction:

We have keywords: for questions related to NVIDIA AI Workbench, locations, contexts, projects, containers, environments, or applications. Also vectorstore if terms: nvwb, aiwb, troubleshooting, ngc, cli, svc, wb-svc, logs, gpu, docker, podman, nim, rag, gradio, jupyterlab are mentioned.

User question is "test". It does not contain any of those keywords? The user says simply "test". So probably then answer: {"datasource": "web_search"}. But let me re-read the instructions:

The system message instructs: "You are an expert at routing a user question to a vectorstore or web search. Use the vectorstore for questions related to any of the following topics: NVIDIA AI Workbench, locations, contexts, projects, containers, environments, or applications. Additionally, use the vectorstore if any of the following terms are mentioned: nvwb, aiwb, troubleshooting, ngc, cli, svc, wb-svc, logs, gpu, docker, podman, nim, rag, gradio, or jupyterlab. Otherwise, use web-search."

User question is "test". It does not include any of these keywords? So it should be "web_search".

We must return a JSON with single key "datasource" and no preamble or explanation.

Return one of the following JSON objects: {"datasource": "web_search"} or {"datasource": "vectorstore"}. For question "test", since not containing any vectorstore keywords, then answer is web search. So we output:

{"datasource": "web_search"}

So I'll reply with: {"datasource": "web_search"}. We must output exactly one JSON object.

I'll now produce the final answer accordingly.</think>{"datasource": "web_search"}
